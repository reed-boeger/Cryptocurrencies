# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this challenge was to take a database of cryptocurrencies and group them based on certain features. This grouped report can be used to inform new crypto investments. The first part of the challenge was to clean the dataset (preprocess) and choose which features were most important. We then used PCA or prinicap component analysis to reduce the data dimensions to 3. We scaled the data used K-means clustering and visualized the data to inform potential investment decisions. The clusters were visualized in a 3D scatter plot with PCA values, where most of the currencies were clustered in the first two groups, and there was a single outlier coin in the 3rd cluster. Further analysis should be done to determine the driving factors behind those two larger groups.
